              <b>BENEFITS OF REGISTERING YOUR PET</b>
              <br />
              <br />
              1. The ID card is great documentation, in addition to your vest, that you have a service animal and are covered under the ADA.
              <br />
              <br />
              2. A landlord or homeownerâ€™s association must provide reasonable accommodation by waiving a no-pet rule or a pet deposit for ALL SERVICE ANIMALS under the ADA.
              <br />
              <br />
              3. Employers must allow service animals in the work place under the ADA.
              <br />
              <br />
              4. There are limited benefits to registering your service animal as they already have rights under the Americans With Disabilities Act (ADA). The registration does not give them any additional rights.
              <br />
              <br />
              <br />
              <b>KNOW YOUR RIGHTS</b>
              <br />
