          <b>Emotional Support Animals</b>
          <br/>
          An emotional support animal is an animal that provides comfort just by being with a person. Because they have not been trained to perform a specific job or task, they do not qualify as service animals under the ADA. However, some state or local governments have laws that allow people to take emotional support animals into public places. You may check with your state and local government agencies to find out about these laws.
          <br/>
          <br/>
          <b>Do I qualify for an emotional support animal?</b>
          <br/>
          If you have an emotional or psychological condition and your animal provides comfort and support, then you could qualify to have an emotional support animal.
          <br/>
          <br/>
          <b>How do you get an emotional support animal?</b>
          <br/>
          You must speak with a mental health professional and find out if you qualify. Any animal or breed can qualify as an emotional support animal.
          <br/>
          <br/>
          <b>What are the benefits of having an emotional support animal?</b>
          <br/>
          Emotional support animals can provide comfort and support for people with many different emotional conditions. A few examples are anxiety, depression, bipolar disorder/mood disorder, panic attacks, fear/phobias and other psychological and emotional conditions.
          <br/>
          <br/>
          <b>Do I need a note from a mental health professional?</b>
          <br/>
          Typically, if you would like to live in no-animal housing with your animal, landlords can legally request that you have a letter from a licensed mental health professional stating your need for your emotional support animal.
          <br/>
          <br/>
          <b>Does my pet qualify as an emotional support animal?</b>
          <br/>
          Any animal or breed can qualify as an emotional support animal as long as it helps support an emotional condition and meets guidelines for legal emotional support animals to have. Please note that if you have an exotic animal you should verify with the appropriate authorities such as Fish and Wildlife that your animal may be legally kept in a home.
          <br/>
          <br/>
          <b>Does my emotional support animal need a vest, leash, tag, collar, etc. to identify him or her?</b>
          <br/>
          While a vest, leash, tag, collar, and other accessories are NOT a requirement for emotional support animals, they can often be helpful in clarifying that your animal is an emotional support animal and reducing questions about your animal.
          <br/>
          <br/>
          <b>What is the Fair Housing Act?</b>
          <br/>
          Under the Fair Housing Act, housing providers are obligated to permit, as a reasonable accommodation, the use of animals that work, provide assistance, or perform tasks that benefit persons with a disabilities, or provide emotional support to alleviate a symptom or effect of a disability.
          <br/>
          <br/>
          <b>My landlord says "no pets allowed," but can I still have an emotional support animal?</b>
          <br/>
          Once your pet is considered an emotional support animal he or she can stay with you at your residence even if they do not allow pets. While for some landlords, a registration may be acceptable, they can legally require that you have a Dr. Letter stating your need for an emotional support animal.

          <b>Service Animals. Do I qualify for a service dog?</b>
          <br/>
          If you have a physical or mental disability that substantially limits one or more major life activities then you are entitled to a service dog that performs tasks for you. No person or business is ever allowed to ask about your disability, require medical documentation, require a special identification card or training documentation for the service dog, or ask that the service dog demonstrate its ability to perform the work or task. In addition, you are never required to disclose what your disability is to anyone.
          <br/>
          <br/>
          <b>Does my dog qualify as a service animal?</b>
          <br/>
          According to the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA), a service animal is defined as a dog that has been individually trained to do work or perform tasks for an individual with a disability. The task(s) performed by the dog must be directly related to the person’s disability. The ADA does not restrict the type of dog breeds that can be service animals. They only have to be trained, either professionally or by the owner, to perform a specific task relating to the owner’s disability.
          <br/>
          <br/>
          <b>What is the American with Disabilities Act (ADA)?</b>
          <br/>
          The ADA requires State and local government agencies, businesses, and nonprofit organizations (covered entities) that provide goods or services to the public to make a "reasonable accommodation" in their policies, practices, or procedures when necessary to accommodate people with disabilities.
          <br/>
          <br/>
          <b>Can I take my service dog anywhere?</b>
          <br/>
          The ADA does not require covered entities to modify policies, practices, or procedures if it would "fundamentally alter" the nature of the goods, services, programs, or activities provided to the public. Nor does it overrule legitimate safety requirements. If admitting service animals would fundamentally alter the nature of a service or program, service animals may be prohibited. In addition, if a particular service animal is out of control and the handler does not take effective action to control it, or if it is not housebroken, that animal may be excluded.
          <br/>
          <br/>
          <b>Can I be asked to leave if my service dog is being disruptive?</b>
          <br/>
          Yes. If a service animal is out of control and the handler does not take effective action to control it, staff may request that the animal be removed from the premises.
          <br/>
          <br/>
          <b>Does my service dog have to be on a leash?</b>
          <br/>
          Service animals must be harnessed, leashed, or tethered while in public places unless these devices interfere with the service animal’s work or the person’s disability prevents use of these devices.
          <br/>
          <br/>
          <b>Are businesses allowed to question me or deny me service?</b>
          <br/>
          In situations where it is not obvious that the dog is a service animal, staff may ask only two specific questions: (1) is the dog a service animal required because of a disability? and (2) what work or task has the dog been trained to perform? Staff are not allowed to request any documentation for the dog, require that the dog demonstrate its task, or inquire about the nature of the person’s disability.
